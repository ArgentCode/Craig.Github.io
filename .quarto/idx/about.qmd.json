When I am not studying or playing with data, I like to read, go hiking, and spend time with my lovely wife Carissa.\n\nMy current objectives are to start a family, expand my volunteering in my community, and to get accepted into a Statistics PhD program! I love to learn about anything statistics related, but in particular I enjoy financial related data. Housing prices, stock predictions, GDP forecasting, and risk assessments all come to mind. I am excited to not only learn about new models and methods to make predicitions, someday I hope to be able to make my own prediction models that are used in industry.\n"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-yaml":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","css":["styles.css"],"toc":true,"output-file":"about.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.1.189","theme":"Mint","title":"About me","about":{"template":"jolla","image":"headshot.jpg","links":[{"icon":"linkedin","text":"Linkedin","href":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/craig-orman0/"},{"icon":"github","text":"Github","href":"https://github.com/ArgentCode"}]}},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}}}}
