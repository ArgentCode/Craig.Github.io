While an Undergraduate Research Assistant at the Center for Statistical Analysis of Forensic Evidence, I worked for [Dr. Heike Hofmann](https://faculty.sites.iastate.edu/hofmann/) to make an application that evaluates the quality of a given bullet scan to see if it will be adequate for striation comparison to another bullet. The intention of said comparison is to see if the bullets can reasonably be determined to have been fired from the same barrel.
